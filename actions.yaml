upload-keytab:
  description: |
    Push the keytab file in base64 format. 
    First, ensure that the keytab to be uploaded's hostname matches the unit hostname. For that,
    discover the unit's FQDN with:
    juju ssh kafka-broker/0 -- hostname -f    
    Command should be similar to:
    juju run-action --wait <unit> upload-keytab keytab="$(cat KEYTAB_FILE | base64 -w0)"

    keytab:
      type: string

set-rack-id:

upgrade:
    description: | 
      Upgrade the kafka packages or snaps.
      When executed, this action will, potentially, remove old packages/snaps and install the new
      version, then executing a config-changed.
